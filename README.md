# LibreOffice Basic Libraries
This repository contains a collection of LibreOffice Basic functions that are designed to make programming LibreOffice Basic easier.

## Possible limitations
The functions provided in this repository were created and tested exclusively on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04). There are no plans to adapt any of these functions to work on Windows or Mac.

## Code readability and comments
The code has been written, indented and commented with maximum ease of readability and comprehensibility for VBA programmers who want to switch to LibreOffice Basic in mind. Shorthand techniques such as nested statements have been avoided to the greatest extent possible.
